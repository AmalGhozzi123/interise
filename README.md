# üìä Automated Competitor Price and Product Monitoring System

## üéØ Project Objective

In a highly competitive market like Tunisia, it is crucial for companies such as Tdiscount to stay informed about competitors' pricing movements and new product releases. This capability directly influences the company's positioning strategy and pricing policy. Currently, companies like Tdiscount rely on manual techniques to monitor product prices and track new products introduced by competitors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Existing System Critique

Manual price monitoring methods present several major drawbacks:

- **Inefficiency in Data Collection:** Manual systems hinder continuous price monitoring and new product tracking, leading to significant delays in reacting to competitors' price changes or new product introductions.
- **Human Error:** Manual processes increase the risk of human errors, leading to inaccuracies or outdated information, which compromises strategic decision-making.
- **Limited Scope:** Manual data collection is labor-intensive and limits the number of competitors and products that can be monitored, reducing market coverage and overall effectiveness.

These flaws highlight the need for a more effective and automated approach to price and product monitoring to enhance competitiveness and market responsiveness.
